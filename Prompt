Run an agentic automated test workflow on https://rahulshettyacademy.com/client/#/auth/login and execute the 3 scenarios below. After execution, produce a detailed test execution table (TC ID, Description, Steps, Expected vs Actual, Status, Notes) and confirm updates to newdata.xlsx.
Scenario 1 – Empty Registration Validation: Try registering with no fields filled. Expect all required-field error messages and registration should fail.
Scenario 2 – Full Registration + API & UI Login: Register using:
* Email: sartha123@test.com
* Phone: 1234567890 (All other fields random valid data.) Then:
1. Save credentials
2. Call login API using the Postman collection
3. Log in through the UI
4. Expect success in both API + UI
5. Write email + password to newdata.xlsx
Scenario 3 – Forgot Password End-to-End:
1. Sign out
2. Reset password via “Forgot Password”
3. Log in with the new password via UI
4. Validate API login with new password
5. Sign out again Expect full success in reset → UI login → API login.
Output:
* One consolidated test execution table
* Confirmation the Excel file was updated
* Use agentic reasoning for UI actions, API calls, and file ops.
